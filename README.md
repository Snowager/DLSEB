With the randomized functionality of the app, users will be shown places they've never been to, even in areas that they are very familiar with. The app offers the perfect answer to the age old question: "Where do you want to eat tonight?" It is also an elegant solution to the troubles of road-trip planning, providing hotels and daily meals and fun activities to do along the way.
